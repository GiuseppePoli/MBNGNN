## Graph Neural Networks for Bipolar Disorder Classification Based on Morphological Brain Networks: An Application to the Multi-Site StratiBip Dataset
An exploration of the use of morphological brain networks (MBNs) and graph neural networks (GNNs) to support the diagnosis of bipolar disorder.

The project is organized into three main components:
- MBN construction using the MIND method
- Experimental trials for the evaluation of different GNN design choices
- Leave-One-Site-Out Cross-Validation (LOSO-CV)
